	"elbow fracture": "Immobilize the elbow in a flexed position with a well-padded splint extending from above the elbow to the hand. Ensure the splint supports both the forearm and the upper arm. Administer pain relief medication such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen as per standard protocol. Schedule an urgent orthopedic consultation to evaluate the need for possible surgical intervention or advanced imaging. Advise the patient to keep the elbow elevated and immobile to reduce swelling and pain. Provide clear instructions on how to manage the splint, including keeping it dry and reporting any signs of increased pain, numbness, or changes in skin color. Arrange a follow-up visit with an orthopedic specialist within 24-48 hours to monitor the fracture's progression and decide on further treatment, which may include casting or surgery.",
	
	"fingers fracture": "Apply a rigid finger splint or use buddy taping to stabilize the affected finger by attaching it to an adjacent finger for support. Ensure the splint or tape is snug but not too tight to avoid compromising blood flow. Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to the finger for 15-20 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours to minimize swelling. Administer pain relief medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen as needed. Refer the patient to a hand specialist to assess the extent of the fracture and determine if further interventions like realignment or casting are necessary. Provide detailed instructions on maintaining finger immobilization, avoiding movement, and monitoring for signs of complications such as persistent pain or changes in finger color. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the specialist within 3-5 days to review healing progress and adjust treatment as necessary.",
	
	"forearm fracture": "Immobilize the forearm using a well-padded splint that extends from just below the elbow to just above the wrist, ensuring both the radius and ulna are supported. Secure the splint with bandages or tape, making sure it's snug but not restrictive. Administer appropriate pain relief, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Arrange for immediate X-ray imaging to determine the exact nature and alignment of the fracture. Depending on the X-ray results, prepare for casting or potential surgical intervention. Educate the patient on keeping the forearm elevated to reduce swelling and avoiding use of the affected arm. Provide written instructions on monitoring for complications such as severe pain, swelling, or loss of circulation, and arrange a follow-up visit within 1-2 days for further evaluation and treatment planning.",
	
	"humerus fracture": "Immobilize the upper arm by placing it in a sling or using a shoulder immobilizer that supports the arm close to the body. Ensure the sling or immobilizer holds the arm in a comfortable position that minimizes movement. Administer pain relief medication as needed, such as acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Refer the patient to an orthopedic surgeon for a detailed evaluation and to discuss possible treatment options, including casting or surgery. Provide instructions on how to care for the sling or immobilizer, emphasizing the importance of keeping the arm immobile and monitoring for signs of complications such as increased pain or numbness. Schedule a follow-up appointment with the orthopedic surgeon within 24-48 hours to assess the fracture's alignment and plan further treatment.",
	
	"humerus injury": "Conduct a thorough assessment to rule out additional injuries to the shoulder and arm. Provide pain management using appropriate medications like ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Schedule a follow-up evaluation to closely monitor the injury and assess if further treatment or imaging is necessary. Provide instructions on managing pain and symptoms, and advise the patient to seek medical attention if they experience worsening symptoms such as increased pain, swelling, or loss of function. Arrange a follow-up visit within a few days to review the patient's progress and make any needed adjustments to their treatment plan.",
	
	"shoulder fracture": "Immobilize the shoulder using a sling or shoulder immobilizer to keep the arm close to the body and reduce movement. Ensure the sling supports the arm properly and minimizes discomfort. Administer pain relief as necessary, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen.

Schedule a follow-up appointment with the orthopedic specialist within 24-48 hours to evaluate the fracture and determine the next steps in treatment.",
	
	"wrist fracture": "Apply a wrist splint that covers the wrist and extends from just below the elbow to just above the knuckles. Ensure the splint is well-padded and secure but not too tight. Apply ice wrapped in a cloth to the wrist for 15-20 minutes every hour for the first 24 hours to reduce swelling. Administer pain relief medication such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Arrange for X-ray imaging to confirm the extent of the fracture and determine the need for casting or further intervention. Provide instructions on immobilizing the wrist, avoiding movement, and monitoring for signs of complications such as severe pain or swelling. Schedule a follow-up visit with an orthopedic specialist within 1-2 days to review the fracture and discuss further treatment options.",

	"no fractures": "Despite no fractures being detected, the patient is experiencing some pain. Provide a thorough examination to rule out any other possible causes of pain such as soft tissue injuries or sprains. Administer appropriate pain relief medication, such as ibuprofen or acetaminophen, to manage discomfort. Advise the patient to rest and avoid activities that may exacerbate the pain. Provide instructions on how to use ice packs to reduce inflammation and pain.
